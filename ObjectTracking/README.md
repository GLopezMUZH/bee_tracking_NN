# Object Tracking

A simple loop over an input video with coordinates tries to track
these coordinates and draws the path of an object on to the output
video. The tracker itself is in the Tracking folder, and the main loop
of utilizing the tracker is located in visualized_tracker.py

IMPORTANT:
To run the code a DB with detected videos is needed. The database file is too big to be uploaded on Github. Please request the Database if you need to run it
